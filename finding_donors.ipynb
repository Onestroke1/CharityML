    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "#### Naive Bayes\n",
    "* Naive Bayes can be useful in the Telecommunications industry when trying to determine customer churn given a large number of customer features such as Monthly Charges, Payment method, Contract type, Tenure, Number of services, Marital status, Gender, etc. \n",
    "* The strengths of Naive Bayes: calculations are fast to compute, it rarely overfits, works well out of the box and rarely needs tuning. It performs well when there are extremely large number of features.\n",
    "* The weakness of Naive Bayes is the assumption that every feature is independent of the other when in fact in Natural Language Processing that is not always the case. Example: Chicago Bulls is a basketball team if each word was independent of the other than you would not get the same results from a search engine for example.\n",
    "* Naive Bayes will be a good candidate for this problem because of the large number of features in this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest\n",
    "* Random Forest can be useful in the Financial industry when trying to predict the risk associated with a bank loan given a large number of customer features such as Current debt, FICO score, Payment history, Education, Income, Years of employment, profession, Gender, Marital status. \n",
    "* The strength of a Random Forest: it is very intuitive and simple to use. It provides interpretable predictions. It performs well on a large number of labeled features. It calculates results quickly and handles unbalanced and missing data well.\n",
    "* The weakness of a Random Forest is that it tends to overfit on noisy data. \n",
    "* Random Forest will be a good candidate for this problem because of the large number of features and it will provide insightful results that can be useful to target potential donors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "* Logistic Regression can be useful in the Medical industry. When trying to determine if patients given features such as Gender, BMI, Age, Daily activity, Cholesteral score, diet, etc. will influence the probablity of having a heart attack (yes or no). \n",
    "* The strength of Logistic Regression is the ability to predict binary outcomes such as yes or no (1 or 0). It can work on both linear and non-linear relationships between the input and output variables.\n",
    "* The weakness of Logistic Regression is that performance decreases if the model has too many non-linear relationships. It does not adapt well to more complex situations. It must be tuned to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "* Logistic Regression will be a good candidate for this problem since we are predicting a binary outcome (donor or not donor).\n"

    "For this problem Logistic Regression was chosen because it performed the best over other models both in results and cost (time and resources to compute). To understand how Logistic Regression is done, you must visualize the dataset as points suspended in a multi-dimensional space. Each point is respresented by the features given from the dataset. For example, age,\n",
    "workclass, education level, occupation, etc are used to calculate the position of a point in a multi-dimensional space. Logistic Regression then tries to separate all points into 2 categories by drawing a line or plane between the two groups of points. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular problem, the model will begin to separate the points to answer the question, \"Is this a potential donor?\" For Logistic Regression the answer must be binary. That is to say, it can only be one of two choices: \"yes\" or \"no\". Using a portion of the dataset for training, the model makes an arbitrary stab at trying to separate the data into \"yes\" or \"no\" groups for potential donors. The model then evaluates itself on it's initial guess by looking at the \"answer\" to see if it categorized each point to the true results that is provided in the training set. Through multiple iterations the model continues to make slight adjustments to the separating plane so that it reaches the maximum likelihood estimation. In other words, the model stops making adjustments when it reaches the highest percentage of correctly categorized points for both \"yes\" and \"no\" groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using what the model learns from the training set, the model applies that learning to the testing set to see how it would perform on data it has not yet seen. Various tools can then measure and evaluate the outcome of the testing set and provide a numerical results that gives the user a sense of how confident the model will do with new data in the real world."

    "The 5 most predictive features from the Random Forest Classifier were a bit surprising to me. I didn't expect education number to be the most important feature for determining income. I thought that it was important but not as important considering my real-world experience where people who have minimal education can also have high incomes. Also, being a husband was surprising to me as I assumed females were more generous than males. I also missed the mark when it comes to capital-gain, since I thought this would be more random as a predictor. I also assumed hours-per-week could be ignored since occupation would determine this feature."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
